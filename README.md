# Heat Diffusion Simulation: FME Faculty

## Overview
This project simulates the thermodynamic distribution and heat evolution within the **FME faculty** building. Developed between **March and May 2025**, it models heat diffusion dynamics using numerical methods to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

The simulation visualizes how temperature gradients propagate through the specific geometry of the building over time.

## Key Features
* **Mathematical Modeling:** Implementation of the **Heat Equation** ($\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u$) to model thermal dynamics.
* **Numerical Analysis:** Utilizes finite difference methods for solving differential equations on a spatial grid.
* **Data Visualization:** Generates 2D heatmaps and temporal animations to analyze temperature shifts.

## Tech Stack
* **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/):** Vectorized numerical computation and matrix manipulation.
* **[SciPy](https://scipy.org/):** Advanced scientific computing algorithms.
* **[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/):** Plotting temperature contours and animation rendering.
